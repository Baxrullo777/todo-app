# Todo App

A simple and effective task management tool built with React and Vite.js. This Todo App helps you manage your daily tasks with ease. Add tasks to your list, check them off as you complete them, and move completed tasks to the 'Done' section. Your tasks are stored locally, ensuring that you never lose track of what's important. Best of all, you can start using it immediatelyâ€”no need to register or log in!

## Features

- **No Account Needed:** Use the app immediately without any registration.
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need to do.
- **Task Completion:** Check off tasks as you complete them. Completed tasks are automatically moved to the 'Done' section.
- **Local Storage:** All your tasks are saved locally on your device, so you never lose your progress.
- **Simple and Responsive UI:** The user interface is clean and responsive, suitable for all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Used for building the user interface with state management to handle the application data.
- **Vite.js:** A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **Local Storage:** Utilizes the browser's local storage to save task data persistently.
